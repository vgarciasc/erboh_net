# ERB Reference Network
> Network of mentions in the web series "Epic Rap Battles of History"

This repository stores the files associated with the "ERB Reference Network". A quick run-down of the files:

- `data.json`: the original JSON which I populate with the data.
- `network-parser.py`: Python script that parses `data.json` and spits out the network in reasonable extensions such as `.gml`.
- `network.json`: Cytoscape data.
- `network.gml`: network in GML format.

You can visualize the network and read more about it [here](https://vinizinho.neocities.org/projects/erboh_net/).
